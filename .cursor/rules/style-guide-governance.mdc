## Style Guide Governance


website-guidelines/STYLE_GUIDE.md is the authoritative global
design system.


When implementing a section:
- If a design decision is reusable, document it in
  website-guidelines/STYLE_GUIDE.md
- If section-specific, keep it in the section file


If implementation diverges from style guide:
1. If new approach looks/works better, keep it
2. Update style guide to match implementation
3. Add changelog entry noting what changed and why


Never silently diverge from the style guide.
