# Project Brief: CodeCookies

## What is it?

**CodeCookies** is an interactive educational platform designed to introduce children to the world of software development through logic-based puzzles and gamified challenges. Instead of starting with complex syntax, the product focuses on teaching the "programming mindset" (sequences, loops, and conditionals) using visual reasoning. As students master these core concepts, the platform provides a seamless transition into **Python** coding. To keep engagement high, the app features a reward system where users earn "cookies" (1 to 5 per task) for successful solutions, with full progress persistence so they can pick up right where they left off.

## Who is it for?

* **Children (Ages 7-12):** Curios kids who want to learn how to create digital content through play.
* **Parents and Homeschoolers:** Seeking high-quality STEM tools that build critical thinking skills.
* **Schools and Educators:** Looking for a structured curriculum to introduce computational thinking before tackling text-based languages.

## What's the goal?

The primary goal is to have users **sign up and complete their first logic challenge**. Success is measured by the user's progression from basic reasoning games to their first executed Python script, driven by the motivation to collect and save "cookies."

## Sections needed

1. **Navigation Bar:** Logo, "My Progress," "Cookie Jar" (Rewards).
2. **Hero Section:** Catchy headline (e.g., "Master the Logic, Build the Future"), an inviting CTA like "Start Earning Cookies," and fun 2D/3D character art.
3. **Features:** Visual breakdown of logic puzzles, the cookie reward system, and the Python bridge.
4. **How It Works:** A 3-step guide: 1. Solve Puzzles, 2. Earn Cookies, 3. Unlock Python.
5. **Benefits:** : A visual grid highlighting:
Logic First: Build a strong foundation before touching code.
Gamified Rewards: Earn cookies for every solved puzzle.
Python Ready: Smooth transition to real-world programming.
Track Progress: Always pick up where you left off.
6. **FAQ:** Questions about age appropriateness, how progress is saved, and safety.
7. **Footer:** Terms of service, privacy policy (COPPA/GDPR compliant), and contact info.

## Additional Requirements

* **Fully responsive:** Optimized for tablets and desktops.
* **Fast loading:** Minimal wait times to maintain a child's attention span.
* **Persistence Layer:** A reliable backend to ensure that cookie counts and level progress are never lost.
* **Child-Friendly UI:** High contrast, large clickable elements, and intuitive feedback sounds when a cookie is earned.
